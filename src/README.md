# About
* A Chess Engine built with Rust. This is a work in progress, and executing the crate with `cargo run` currently just runs the unit tests.

# TODO 
* Rename Move type as Action
* Abstract identical can_move() and can_capture() implementations.
* Abstract horizontal/diagonal movement
* Maybe rename GameBoard as State
